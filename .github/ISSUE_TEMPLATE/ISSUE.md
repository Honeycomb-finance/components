Tip: include an error message (in a `<details></details>` tag) if your issue is related to an error while running Components.

If you include an animated gif showing your issue, wrapping it in a details tag is also recommended. Gifs usually autoplay, which can cause accessibility issues for people reviewing your PR:

    <details>
      <summary>Summary of your gif(s)</summary>
      <img src="..." alt="Description of what the gif shows">
    </details>
